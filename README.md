*Notes from my personal development journey*

I am a software developer and was miserable for years. What's changed in recent years was my mindset. 
I picked up the following book a few years back:

This book planted the seed to a better life for me. One of the habits mentioned is to [sharpen the saw](https://wspucla.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/habit-7-sharpen-the-saw/).
That's where I picked the need for spiritual practice and am grateful for it because my mindset has changed to the better. My life isn't perfect; but, it's in a much better place and I enjoy my work because of it.

# is it time to hire a CPA to do my taxes?
I switched from turbo tax to a CPA at the same time that I was transitioning my mindset from being a W2 worker to planning for a future where working would be optional. This included strategies to reduce my taxable income, leveraging real estate investing, and being a business owner. I am 25% into my journey. 
Having a CPA has helped me rely on someone to bounce ideas as I go through my journey. Most people view a CPA as someone to talk to once a year. I use my CPA through the year as I start planning opportunities to grow my wealth.
